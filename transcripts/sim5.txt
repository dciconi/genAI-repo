Generated Question: Introduction and Context:

In the study of ancient civilizations, historians and archaeologists often rely on various sources of evidence to understand the beliefs, practices, and achievements of these societies. One important skill in analyzing and interpreting these sources is the ability to link opinions and reasons using words, phrases, and clauses. By making these connections, we can better understand the thought processes and motivations behind the opinions expressed in the sources.

Consider the following excerpt from an ancient text:

"The construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza was an incredible feat of engineering. The precision with which the massive stones were cut and placed is a testament to the advanced knowledge and skills of the ancient Egyptians. Consequently, it is clear that the pharaohs of Egypt possessed a deep understanding of mathematics and geometry."

Based on this excerpt, answer the following question:

Question:

How does the author use words and phrases to link the opinion about the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza to the reason that the pharaohs of Egypt possessed a deep understanding of mathematics and geometry? Provide specific examples from the text to support your answer.
