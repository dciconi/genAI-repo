Wildlife conservation is a pressing issue in today's world. As human activities continue to encroach upon natural habitats, many species are facing the threat of extinction. Conservation efforts aim to protect these endangered species and preserve biodiversity. These efforts include establishing protected areas, implementing laws to prohibit hunting, and promoting sustainable practices. However, despite these measures, many species continue to decline in numbers. Some argue that more aggressive strategies are needed, while others believe that current efforts are sufficient and need more time to show results.

Student's Answer (level 2): Wildlife conservation, yeah? It's a big deal, no doubt. We're seeing more and more animals getting closer to extinction because of what we're doing to their homes. We've got laws and stuff to try and stop hunting and we're trying to make sure we're not destroying everything, but it's not really working, is it? Some people reckon we need to do more, others think we just need to give it time. I reckon we need to step it up a notch.

Look, it's not like we're not trying. We've got protected areas, laws against hunting, all that jazz. But it's not enough. We're still seeing numbers go down. We need to do more. We need to be more aggressive with our conservation strategies. 

I mean, think about it. We're not just talking about a few animals here. We're talking about entire species. Once they're gone, they're gone for good. We can't just sit back and hope for the best. We need to take action. We need to do whatever it takes to make sure these animals are around for future generations.

So yeah, in conclusion, we need to do more. We need to be more aggressive with our conservation

Evaluation: Overall, your essay scores a 4 out of 8. 

In terms of formal style and tone, your essay scores a 1. The language used is quite informal and colloquial, which is not suitable for a formal essay. Phrases such as "yeah?", "no doubt", "stuff", "is it?", "reckon", and "all that jazz" are examples of informal language. 

Regarding structure and organization, your essay scores a 3. You have an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which is good. However, your argument could be more clearly developed and your points could flow more logically.

To improve, I would suggest maintaining a formal style and tone throughout your essay. Avoid using slang and colloquial language. Instead, use sophisticated and appropriate language for the topic. In terms of structure, make sure each paragraph supports your argument and flows logically from one to the next. Make your argument clear and concise, and ensure your points are well-developed and logically ordered.
