Generated Question: Introduction and Context:

Climate change is a pressing global issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years. The Earth's climate is changing at an alarming rate due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the planet to warm. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of biodiversity.

To address the topic of climate change, it is essential to develop a well-rounded understanding of the issue by providing relevant, well-chosen facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples. This approach helps to support arguments, provide evidence, and engage readers or listeners in a meaningful way.

Free-Response Question:

Read the following excerpt from a scientific article on climate change:

"According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global average temperature has increased by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era. This rise in temperature is primarily attributed to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. The increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, trapping heat and causing the Earth's climate to change."

In your own words, develop the topic of climate change with relevant, well-chosen facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples. Use the provided excerpt as a starting point and expand upon it to demonstrate your understanding of the issue.

Student's Answer: Climate change is a big problem caused by people doing things like burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees. This releases greenhouse gases into the air, which makes the Earth get hotter. The consequences of climate change are bad, like the sea levels rising, extreme weather happening more often, and animals and plants dying. According to the IPCC, the global temperature has gone up by about 1.1 degrees Celsius since a long time ago. This is because of human activities, especially burning fossil fuels. The greenhouse effect is when greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and make the climate change. So, climate change is a serious issue that we need to understand better and do something about.

Evaluation: Overall Score: 2 out of 4

Feedback:
- The answer provides a basic understanding of climate change and mentions some relevant facts and consequences. However, the response lacks depth and does not fully develop the topic with well-chosen facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples.
- The answer briefly mentions the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation as human activities causing climate change, but it does not elaborate on the specific greenhouse gases released or their impact on the atmosphere.
- The consequences of climate change are mentioned, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of biodiversity, but there is no further explanation or supporting evidence provided.
- The mention of the IPCC and the global temperature increase of 1.1 degrees Celsius is a relevant fact, but it is not expanded upon or connected to the broader topic of climate change.
- The concept of the greenhouse effect is briefly mentioned, but there is no further elaboration on how it relates to climate change or its role in trapping heat in the atmosphere.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- To improve the response, provide more specific and detailed information about the greenhouse gases released from burning fossil fuels and deforestation, and their impact on the Earth's atmosphere.
- Expand on the consequences of climate change by providing examples and supporting evidence for rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of biodiversity.
- Connect the mention of the IPCC and the global temperature increase to the broader topic of climate change, explaining the significance of these findings.
- Provide a more thorough explanation of the greenhouse effect and its role in trapping heat in the atmosphere, linking it to the overall concept of climate change.

Remember, developing the topic with relevant, well-chosen facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples will strengthen your response and demonstrate a deeper understanding of climate change.
